				CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son
				and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing far
				beyond the world
				of known physics.
			</p>
			<p class="nyt-imperial">
				He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have been
				created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
				potential hitch in the presumed
				course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a
				repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously violent
				instant.
			</p>
			<p class="nyt-imperial">
				If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
				and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
				irregularities. Those
				particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
			</p>
			<p class="nyt-imperial">
				“SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.

					Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#" class="link-section">the first sliver of
						cosmic time</a>
					with telescopes at the South Pole, a team
					of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics detected
					ripples in the fabric of
					space-time — so-called <a href="#" class="link-section">gravitational waves</a>
					— the signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a
					trillionth of a trillionth of a second old.
					They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say,
					that Dr. Guth was correct.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including Dr. Guth,
					wondered whether it could ever be proved.
				</p>
				<p>
					If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable to the recent
					discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
					realms of
					time and space and energy to science and speculation.
				</p>
				<p>
					Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space
					with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose
					extent,
					architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe
					there might be an endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of
					pasta water boiling over.

				In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces operating at energies forever beyond the
				reach of particle accelerators on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s ripples
				would be the first direct
				observation of gravitational waves, which,
				according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should ruffle space-time.
			</p>
			<p>
				Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe expert who was not part of the team,
				said, “This is huge, as big as it gets.”
			</p>
			<p>
				He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe, sending a telegram encoded in
				gravitational waves.”
			</p>
			<p>
				The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a bath of microwave radiation that
				permeates space and preserves a picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot as the
				surface of the sun.
			</p>
			<p>
				Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known as Bicep, for Background Imaging of
				Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization, reported
				their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of
				papers submitted to The Astrophysical Journal.

				Confused, Dr. Linde called out to his wife, asking if she had ordered anything.
			</p>
			<p>
				“And then I told him that in the beginning we thought that this was a delivery but we did not think that
				we ordered anything, but I simply forgot that actually I did order it, 30 years ago,” Dr. Linde wrote in
				an email.
			</p>
			<p>
				Calling from Bonaire, the Dutch Caribbean island, Dr. Linde said he was still hyperventilating. “Having
				news like this is the best way of spoiling a vacation,” he said.
			</p>

			<p>
				By last weekend, as social media was buzzing with rumors that inflation had been seen and news spread,
				astrophysicists responded with a mixture of jubilation and caution.
			</p>
			<p>
				Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at M.I.T., wrote in an email, “I think that if this stays true, it will go
				down as one of the greatest discoveries in the history of science.”
			</p>
			<p>
				John E. Carlstrom of the University of Chicago, Dr. Kovac’s mentor and head of a competing project
				called the South Pole Telescope, pronounced himself deeply impressed. “I think the results are beautiful
				and very convincing,”
				he said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Paul J. Steinhardt of Princeton, author of a competitor to inflation that posits the clash of a pair of
				universes as the cause of genesis, said that if true, the Bicep result would eliminate his model, but he
				expressed reservations about inflation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Lawrence M. Krauss of Arizona State and others also emphasized the need for confirmation, noting that
				the new results
				exceeded earlier estimates based on temperature maps of the cosmic background by the European Space
				Agency’s Planck
				satellite and other assumptions about the universe.
			</p>
			<p>
				“So we will need to wait and see before we jump up and down,” Dr. Krauss said.
			</p>
			<p>
				Corroboration might not be long in coming. The Planck spacecraft will report its own findings this year.
				At least a

				Gravity waves are the latest and deepest secret yet pried out of the cosmic microwaves, which were
				discovered accidentally by Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson at Bell Labs 50 years ago. They won the Nobel
				Prize.
			</p>

			<p>
				Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of
				Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where
				the
				thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of
				Minnesota,
				Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
			</p>
			<p>
				“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has
				been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.

			<p>
				In 2002, he was part of a team that discovered that the microwave radiation was polarized, meaning the
				light waves had a slight preference to vibrate in one direction rather than another.
			</p>
			<p>
				This was a step toward the ultimate goal of detecting the gravitational waves from inflation. Such
				waves, squeezing space in one direction and stretching it in another as they go by, would twist the
				direction
				of polarization of the microwaves, theorists said. As a result, maps of the
				polarization in the sky should have little arrows going in spirals.
			</p>
			<p>
				Detecting those spirals required measuring infinitesimally small differences in the temperature of the
				microwaves. The group’s telescope, Bicep2, is basically a giant superconducting thermometer.
			</p>
			<p>
				“We had no expectations what we would see,” Dr. Kovac said.
			</p>
			<p>
				The strength of the signal surprised the researchers, and they spent a year burning up time on a Harvard
				supercomputer, making sure they had things
				right and worrying that competitors might beat them to the breakthrough.
			</p>
			<p class="nyt-imperial-bold">
				A Special Time
			</p>
			<p>
				The data traced the onset of inflation to a time that physicists like Dr. Guth, staying up late in his
				Palo Alto house 35 years ago, suspected was a special break point in the evolution of the universe.
			</p>
			<p>
				Physicists recognize four forces at work in the world today: gravity, electromagnetism, and strong and
				weak nuclear forces. But they have long suspected that those are simply different manifestations of a
				single unified force that ruled the universe in its earliest, hottest moments.
			</p>
			<p>
				As the universe cooled, according to this theory, there was a fall from grace, like some old folk
				mythology of gods or brothers falling out with each other.
				The laws of physics evolved, with one force after another splitting away.
			</p>
			<p>
				That was where Dr. Guth came in.
			</p>
			<p>
				Under some circumstances, a glass of water can stay liquid as the temperature falls below 32 degrees,
				until it is disturbed, at which point it will rapidly freeze, releasing latent heat.
			</p>
			<p>
				Similarly, the universe could “supercool” and stay in a unified state too long. In that case, space
				itself would become imbued with a mysterious latent energy.
			</p>
			<p>
				Inserted into Einstein’s equations, the latent energy would act as a kind of antigravity, and the
				universe would blow itself up. Since it was space itself supplying the repulsive force,
				the more space was created, the harder it pushed apart.
			</p>
			What would become our observable universe mushroomed in size at least a trillion trillionfold — from a
			submicroscopic speck of primordial energy to the
			size of a grapefruit — in less than a cosmic eye-blink.
			<p>
				Almost as quickly, this pulse would subside, relaxing into ordinary particles and radiation. All of
				normal cosmic history was still ahead, resulting in
				today’s observable universe, a patch of sky and stars billions of light-years across. “It’s often said
				that there is no such thing as a free lunch,” Dr. Guth likes to say, “but the universe might be the
				ultimate free lunch.”
			</p>
			<p>
				Make that free lunches. Most of the hundred or so models resulting from Dr. Guth’s original vision
				suggest that inflation, once started, is eternal. Even as our own universe settled down to a comfortable
				homey expansion,
				the rest of the cosmos will continue blowing up, spinning off other bubbles endlessly,
				a concept known as the multiverse.
			</p>
			<p>
				So the future of the cosmos is perhaps bright and fecund, but do not bother asking about going any
				deeper into the past.
			</p>
			<p>
				We might never know what happened before inflation, at the very beginning, because inflation erases
				everything that came before it. All the chaos and randomness of the primordial moment are swept away,
				forever out of our view.
			</p>
			<p>
				“If you trace your cosmic roots,” said Abraham Loeb, a Harvard-Smithsonian astronomer who was not part
				of the team, “you wind up at inflation.”
